// SysTick.c
// Runs on LM4F120/TM4C123
// Provide functions that initialize the SysTick module, wait at least a
// designated number of clock cycles, and wait approximately a multiple
// of 10 milliseconds using busy wait.  After a power-on-reset, the
// LM4F120 gets its clock from the 16 MHz precision internal oscillator,
// which can vary by +/- 1% at room temperature and +/- 3% across all
// temperature ranges.  If you are using this module, you may need more
// precise timing, so it is assumed that you are using the PLL to set
// the system clock to 50 MHz.  This matters for the function
// SysTick_Wait10ms(), which will wait longer than 10 ms if the clock is
// slower.
