// Switch.h
// Runs on LM4F120/TM4C123
// Provide functions that initialize a GPIO as an input pin and
// allow reading of two negative logic switches on PF0 and PF4
// and an external switch on PA5.
// Use bit-banded I/O.

// negative logic switches connected to PF0 and PF4 on the Launchpad

// NOTE: The NMI (non-maskable interrupt) is on PF0.  That means that
// the Alternate Function Select, Pull-Up Resistor, Pull-Down Resistor,
// and Digital Enable are all locked for PF0 until a value of 0x4C4F434B
// is written to the Port F GPIO Lock Register.  After Port F is
// unlocked, bit 0 of the Port F GPIO Commit Register must be set to
// allow access to PF0's control registers.  On the LM4F120, the other
// bits of the Port F GPIO Commit Register are hard-wired to 1, meaning
// that the rest of Port F can always be freely re-configured at any
// time.  Requiring this procedure makes it unlikely to accidentally
// re-configure the JTAG and NMI pins as GPIO, which can lock the
// debugger out of the processor and make it permanently unable to be
// debugged or re-programmed.

// Initialize GPIO Port F bit 5 for input

// Output: none

//------------Switch_Input------------

// Input: none
// Output: 0x20 if PF5 is high
//         0x00 if PF5 is low

//------------Board_Init------------
// Initialize GPIO Port F for negative logic switches on PF0 and
// PF4 as the Launchpad is wired.  Weak internal pull-up
// resistors are enabled, and the NMI functionality on PF0 is
// disabled.
// Input: none
// Output: none

//------------Board_Input------------
// Read and return the status of the switches.
// Input: none
// Output: 0x01 if only Switch 1 is pressed
//         0x10 if only Switch 2 is pressed
//         0x00 if both switches are pressed
//         0x11 if no switches are pressed
