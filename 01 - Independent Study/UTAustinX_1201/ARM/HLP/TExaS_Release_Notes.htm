<h1 style="text-align: center;">Release Notes for TExaS</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Starter projects for Labs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">UT.12.01x Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape The
World</h2>
<b>This version fixes the MSP432 bug that incorrectly set the clock speed to 48 MHz. </b>
Test EXecute, And Simulate, called <span style="font-weight: bold;">TExaS</span>,
is a collection of DLL
plugins that transform Keil uVision into learning environment for
embedded systems. These plugins provide simulation of the Texas
Instruments Tiva LaunchPad.
The suite also includes a stand-alone application called TExaSdisplay, which provides a serial port interface. 
When operating with the code embedded on the microcontroller, TExaSdisplay also provides a oscilloscope
and logic analyzer functionality. 
 Furthermore, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TExaS</span> can be used for
automatic grading of labs on the real board for UT.12.01x.<br>
