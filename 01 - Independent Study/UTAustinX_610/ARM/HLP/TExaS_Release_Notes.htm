Test EXecute, And Simulate, called <span style="font-weight: bold;">TExaS</span>,
is a collection of DLL
plugins that transform Keil uVision into learning environment for
embedded systems. These plugins provide simulation of the Texas
Instruments Tiva LaunchPad.
The suite also includes a stand-alone application called TExaSdisplay, which provides a serial port interface. 
When operating with the code embedded on the microcontroller, TExaSdisplay also provides a oscilloscope functionality. 
 Furthermore, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TExaS</span> can be used for
automatic grading of labs both in simulation and on the real board.<br>
