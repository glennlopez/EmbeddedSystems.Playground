Time is a critical parameter in an embedded system. In this chapter, we will further develop SysTick as a means to control time in our embedded system. We will activate the phase-lock-loop (PLL) for two reasons. First, by selecting the bus frequency we can tradeoff power for speed. Second, by creating a bus clock based on an external crystal, system time will be more accurate. An effective development process will be to separate what the system does from how it works. This abstraction will be illustrated during the design of finite state machines (FSM). All embedded systems have inputs and outputs, but FSMs have states in addition to inputs and outputs. We will embody knowledge, “what we know” or “where we’ve been”, by being in a state.  A traffic light and vending machine will be implemented using FSMs. Finally, we will introduce stepper motors and show how to use a FSM to control them.

Learning Objectives:
=================

* Learn how to activate the PLL so the microcontroller has an accurate time base
* Use SysTick to produce accurate time delays
* Learn how to organize data on the computer using structures
* Develop a design strategy for building Finite State Machines
* Explain how stepper motors work using two motors to make an autonomous robot
